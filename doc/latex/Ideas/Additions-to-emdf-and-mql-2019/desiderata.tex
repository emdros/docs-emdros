\section{Introduction}

This paper describes, motives, explains, and exemplifies some
desiderata for a new MQL and EMdF model.

\section{New EMdF}

\subsection{Introduction}

The following are proposed as additions to the high-level abstraction
of EMdF:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Virtual objects:} That is, objects which have a place in
  the monad stream, because they are anchored in the text, but which
  are not part of the main text at that point in the monad stream.
  
\item \textbf{Extra-textual objects:} That is, objects which are not
  part of the main text, but which also do not have a natural
  anchoring at a specific location in the text.  Rather, they are
  outside the text, and are referred to by objects in the text, and
  perhaps also the other way around.

\item \textbf{Better declaration of properties of and relationships
  between monad set features:} It should be possible to declare
  explicitly certain properties of monad set features, as well as
  declaring that certain monad set features are to be interpreted in
  the same context.

\item \textbf{Better typing of feature values:} Certain types of
  feature values should be better handled.  See below for concrete
  suggestions.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In order to implement these high-level abstractions, the
following are proposed as additions to the concrete implementation of
EMdF:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Named monad streams:} Right now, there is only one monad
  stream.  It is currently unnamed, but I propose calling it ``main''
  in the future.  This should always be declared implicitly at
  database creation time.

  We should add the ability to declare separate monad streams and call
  them something else.

  It should also be possible to declare at object type creation time
  that a given set-of-monads feature belongs to a given, previously
  explicitly or implicitly declared, monad stream.

  All monad set features should default to being in the ``main'' monad
  stream when the feature is being created, unless Emdros is directed
  otherwise by the user.  This is true of both the ``monads'' feature,
  which is always created, and all other monad set features.
  
  This will gain us these advantages:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Monad set can be declared to belong to a certain monad stream.
    This will make the relationships explicit.  This explicitation is
    useful in two ways:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item It helps the database designer think about his textual
        domain.
      \item It helps the EMdF and MQL layers detect errors in usage.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Separation of different textual streams:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sometimes, different kinds of text in a document all belong
      to the document, but are of entirely different natures, and
      actually are separate parts of the same document.  Examples
      include: Footnotes, Apparatuses, Inserts, and other parts of the
      document which have an anchoring in the main text, but which are
      not part of the main text.
    \item Sometimes, a database needs to contain extra-textual data
      which is not part of the main text, nor has a natural placement
      in the document reading order, but which is nevertheless
      important information for the reading / interpretation of the
      document.  Having the ability to declare separate monad streams
      for these kinds of objects is a real advantage.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Declarared monad set range types:} It should be
  possible, at object type creation time, to declare that a given
  monad set feature (not just ``monads'', but all features of type SET
  OF MONADS) is of a given range type: SINGLE MONAD, SINGLE RANGE, or
  MULTIPLE RANGE set of monads.
  
\item \textbf{Observed monad set range types:} The EMdF engine should
  keep track of the range types of all monad sets of all objects in
  all object types, both the ``monads'' feature and all other monad
  set features.  That is, when an object is created, the EMdF engine
  should store the largest range type that is used by the actual
  objects for this feature.  This should be according to this cline:

  \begin{center}
    \texttt{MULTIPLE RANGE} $>$ \texttt{SINGLE RANGE} $>$ \texttt{SINGLE MONAD}
  \end{center}
  
  \noindent This will help the MQL engine decide optimizations better.
  
\item \textbf{Virtual object metadata:} At object creation time (not
  object type creation time), it should be possible to declare that a
  given object of the given object type is ``virtual'', in the sense
  that, while it has a placement in the monad stream, it is not
  necessarily a part of the main text of that monad stream.  Instead,
  it sits ``between'' two monads.  This, if the two monads between
  which it sits are adjacent, the virtual object has zero extent.  If
  the two monads between which it sits are not adjacent, then the
  virtual object \textit{is} part\_of the monad stream by at least one
  monad.
 
  A possible way to implement this is outlined below.
 
\item \textbf{Virtual object adjacency rules:} Given that a virtual
  object has a placement in the monad stream, but may have zero
  extent, it becomes necessary to define adjacency rules between
  ``normal'' objects and virtual objects.

  A possible way to implement this is also outlined below.

\item \textbf{Better handling of feature types:} Certain
  possibilities have suggested themselves over the course of using
  the current typing schema.  These include:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    
  \item \textbf{Arbitrary strings as enumeration constants:} It
    should be possible to define enumeration constants by means of
    arbitrary strings, not just C identifiers.
    
  \item \textbf{Arbitrary strings in lists of enumeration constants:}
    Of course, when a feature type is ``LIST OF
    \textit{enumeration}'', then it should also be possible to use
    strings in those lists.
      
  \item \textbf{LIST OF STRING:} It should be possible to declare that
    a given feature is of type LIST OF STRING, meaning a list of
    arbitrary strings.
      
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}
