# Introduction

Welcome to the MQL Programmer’s Guide. MQL is the query language
associated with the EMdF model, as implemented in the [Emdros text
database engine](https://emdros.com/).

MQL is a “full access language,” which simply means that MQL lets you
**create**, **update**, **delete**, and **query** most of the data
domains in the EMdF model – databases, objects, object types,
features, etc. MQL is your front-end to the EMdF database model. This
guide helps you formulate MQL queries that do what you need done with
your Emdros database.

This guide has the following chapters:

1. The first is this chapter on preliminaries.

2. The second is a gentle introduction to the EMdF model, which
underlies the MQL language.

3. The third chapter deals with manipulating an EMdF schema with MQL.

4. The fourth chapter deals with manipulating EMdF data with MQL.

5. The fifth chapter deals with MQL meta statements, i.e., transactions and how to quit a connection to an MQL backend.

6. The sixth chapter deals with the "topographic" part of MQL, i.e., the part that is used to query the structure of the data.

7. The seventh chapter is an "About" section.

This chapter will proceed as follows. First, we present a short
history of MdF, EMdF, and MQL. Second, we give a gentle introduction
to Backus-Naur Form, or BNF, which will be used throughout chapters 3
to 6. 

But first, an explanation of where EMdF and MQL come from.
