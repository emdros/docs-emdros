# Introduction

This chapter is a gentle introduction to the “EMdF model”. The EMdF
model is a “database model.” As such, it provides a solid theoretical
foundation for the EMdF database engine and the MQL query language.
However, its importance goes beyond being a theoretical foundation. The
EMdF model defines the very way we talk about text in an EMdF database,
and as such, it provides the “vocabulary” of the language by which you,
the user, communicate with the EMdF database engine. Put another way,
the EMdF model defines the concepts which you use to talk about text
when communicating with the EMdF database engine. Thus it is very
important that you understand all of the concepts involved in the EMdF
model. However, these concepts are neither many nor difficult to
understand. This chapter is designed to help you understand them,
whatever your background.

This chapter is built around the concepts in the EMdF model:

- monads,
- objects,
- object types,
- features, and
- a few other concepts.

The first four of these concepts form the backbone of the EMdF
model. Once you have understood these, the rest are mere extensions
which follow fairly easily.
