# Encryption

Dr. D. Richard Hipp, the author of SQLite, makes an encryption-enabled
version available for a fee. There is skeleton support for SQLite
encryption in Emdros, meaning one should be able to use Dr. Hipp’s
encryption-enabled version of SQLite with Emdros and get
encryption-support in Emdros on SQLite. This has not been tested,
however; only the skeleton is there. See [Dr. Hipp's
website](https://www.sqlite.org/), for more information about
Dr. Hipp’s encryption.

In this manual, when we speak of “encryption” on SQLite, please be
aware that the actual encryption is not a part of Emdros, and you will
achieve the exact same results and generate the exact same Emdros
databases whether you use a key or not, unless you obtain an
encryption-enabled SQLite from somewhere.
